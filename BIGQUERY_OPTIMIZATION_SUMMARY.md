## üìä Before vs After Comparison

### BEFORE (Data Warehouse Queries)
```sql
-- Example: Customer Analytics (Old Complex Query)
WITH customer_base AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_unique_id,
        c.customer_state,
        COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id) as total_orders,
        ROUND(SUM(oi.price), 2) as total_spent,
        ROUND(AVG(oi.price), 2) as avg_order_value,
        ROUND(AVG(r.review_score), 1) as avg_review_score,
        MIN(o.order_purchase_timestamp) as first_order_date,
        MAX(o.order_purchase_timestamp) as last_order_date,
        DATE_DIFF(DATE(MAX(o.order_purchase_timestamp)), 
                  DATE(MIN(o.order_purchase_timestamp)), DAY) as customer_lifespan_days
    FROM `project-olist-470307.dbt_olist_dwh.fact_order_items` oi
    JOIN `project-olist-470307.dbt_olist_dwh.dim_customer` c ON oi.customer_sk = c.customer_sk
    JOIN `project-olist-470307.dbt_olist_dwh.dim_orders` o ON oi.order_sk = o.order_sk
    LEFT JOIN `project-olist-470307.dbt_olist_dwh.dim_order_reviews` r ON oi.order_sk = r.order_sk
    WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
segmented_customers AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE 
            WHEN total_spent >= 1000 AND total_orders >= 5 THEN 'VIP'
            WHEN total_spent >= 500 AND total_orders >= 3 THEN 'High Value'
            WHEN total_spent >= 200 AND total_orders >= 2 THEN 'Regular'
            WHEN total_spent >= 50 THEN 'Low Value'
            ELSE 'One-time'
        END as customer_segment
    FROM customer_base
)
SELECT * FROM segmented_customers ORDER BY total_spent DESC
```

### AFTER (Optimized Analytics Query)
```sql
-- Example: Customer Analytics (New Optimized Query)
SELECT 
    customer_sk,
    customer_id,
    customer_state,
    customer_city,
    total_orders,
    total_spent,
    avg_order_value,
    days_as_customer as customer_lifespan_days,
    avg_review_score,
    first_order_date,
    last_order_date,
    customer_segment,
    churn_risk_level,
    satisfaction_tier,
    geographic_region,
    market_tier,
    predicted_annual_clv,
    annual_spending_rate,
    categories_purchased,
    satisfaction_rate_pct,
    purchase_frequency_tier
FROM `project-olist-470307.dbt_olist_analytics.customer_analytics_obt`
WHERE total_orders > 0
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
```
