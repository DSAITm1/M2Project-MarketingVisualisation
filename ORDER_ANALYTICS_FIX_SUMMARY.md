# Order Analytics Page Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Root Cause Identified and Fixed

The **Order Analytics page was empty** because of a critical Streamlit multi-page application issue:

### 🔍 **Problem**: 
In Streamlit multi-page apps, pages loaded through navigation **DO NOT** execute the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This meant the `main()` function was never being called when users navigated to the Order Analytics page.

### 🔧 **Solution Applied**:
Replaced the conditional execution pattern with direct function calls in ALL analytics pages:

**Before (Broken):**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**After (Working):**
```python
# Call main function directly for Streamlit pages
main()
```

### 📊 **Pages Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Order Analytics** (`pages/2_🛒_Order_Analytics.py`) - Now loading data and displaying charts
2. ✅ **Review Analytics** (`pages/3_⭐_Review_Analytics.py`) - Fixed execution issue  
3. ✅ **Geographic Analytics** (`pages/4_🗺️_Geographic_Analytics.py`) - Fixed execution issue
4. ✅ **Customer Analytics** (`pages/1_👥_Customer_Analytics.py`) - Preventive fix applied

### 🚀 **Additional Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed deprecated `use_container_width=True` → `width="stretch"` warnings
- ✅ Restored proper caching with `@st.cache_data(ttl=1800)`
- ✅ Maintained all data processing and visualization functionality
- ✅ Cleaned up debug messages
